I work with utility Jconsole on my class userUsage.
by use this program I can see that program   used GC1,
and Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM version 14+36-1461.
We see Total compile time:Â 1,738 seconds and VM time work itc
Treds  quantity all and current demons and treads
Quantity of classes - 2.
current heap size 6.2 m
all memory for using by heap 147 m and max heap size 2 GB.
during working our program we use only Name = 'G1 Young Generation', Collections = 67, Total time spent = 0,168 seconds
This means that our program a little and doesn't demand a lot resources(No using old generation).
0,168 seconds on G1 Young Generation (67 collections ) time all collections and how much we call collections.
we can use non heap memory using and size
we can see size of all  generations and set it If it need.
